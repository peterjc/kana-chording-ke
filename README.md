This repository is a holding point for assorted keyboard layout experiments
focused on Japanese text entry, and in particular the possibilities offered
by keyboard chording. Currently this is focused on in-software keyboard
modification on macOS using the free open source software [Karabiner
Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/), but many of the ideas could
equally be done with a programmable keyboard.

Currently there are two main sub-projects:

* [Flick-input like Japanese keyboard chording using cursor
  keys](cursor-chording-flick-input.md) where for example the `k` or `か`
  (ka) key alone gives か, but in combination with `←`, `↑`, `↓`, or `→`
  gives き, く, け, or こ (ki, ku, ke, ko) mimicking the touch-screen iOS
  12-key flick input.

* [New Stickney Japanese keyboard layout](new-stickney-in-macos.md) where
  for example Qwerty `q` with the standard JIS layout gives `た`, but is
  remapped to `f` in order to give `け` as per the New Stickney layout.
