"""Generate Karabiner Elements JSON for Hands Down layout on a JIS MacBook.

The Apple MacBook sold in Japan has a JIS based keyboard layout which has a
quite different bottom row compared to Apple's ANSI/US or ISO/European layouts).
In particular, the spacebar is shorter - just over three keys wide and found
underneath the Qwerty VBN keys. It is flanked on the by the "eisuu" (switch to
qwerty) and "kana" (switch to Japanese mode) keys. This is important as it
offers a way to use this bottom row for thumb keys, like the letter "R" as
used on the left-thumb in many of the "Hands Down" alternative layouts.

This allows us to remap the letter keys while still using the same home row
(although we use a "wide mod" and shift the right hand further over), while
using (left-command), "eisuu" and spacebar for the left thumb, and "kana",
right-command (and globe/fn?) for the right thumb keys.

The number row is also altered, after digits one to zero placed US style
back-tick/tilde, Z and Q in top right corner in favour of hyphen and equals
(which are in the right-hand's core 5x3 block instead).

The specific layout I am using is a personal variant of "Hands Down Promethium"
(top/bottom inverted, minor letters moved about) with the punctuation placement
partly based on "Enthium" (top/bottom inverted, unmirrored).

The thumb-keys are R on "eisuu" & backspace on spacebar for the left-thumb,
and shift on "kana" & space on right-command for the right-thumb. Bottom left
caps-lock becomes left-shift, with left-option and left-command unchanged.

The left-hand home-keys are "SNTH" on Qwerty A, S, D, and F (i.e. unchanged).
The right-hand home-keys are "AEIC" on Qwerty L, semicolon, colon, and close quote
(which are L, semicolon, quote, backslash on ANSI; i.e. shifted two keys right).
This makes enter an easy but potentially tiring horizontal pinkie finger move.

This leaves a 2-2-3 central block (Qwerty YU, HJ, and BNM) into which the
punctuation typically on the right is transplanted (same row and order).

The number row is also altered, after digits one to zero I placed US style
back-tick/tilde (a surprisingly comfortable middle finger stretch now), then
Z and Q in top right corner. Hyphen and equals are in the right-hand's core
5x3 block instead, with international3 (Â¥ and |) moved to the centre block.

The KE rules are deliberately defined not to be active in Japanese mode,
meaning Kana mode should still work, as will Romaji-Qwerty mode (although
you might want to type romaji using Hands Down?).

This assumes the Karabiner Elements virtual device will be in JIS mode
(important for punctuation to work as expected - but not done yet!).
