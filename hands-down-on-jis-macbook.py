"""Generate Karabiner Elements JSON for Hands Down layout on a JIS MacBook.

The Apple MacBook sold in Japan has a JIS based keyboard layout which has a
quite different bottom row compared to Apple's ANSI/US or ISO/European layouts).
In particular, the spacebar is shorter - just over three keys wide and found
underneath the Qwerty VBN keys. It is flanked on the by the "eisuu" (switch to
qwerty) and "kana" (switch to Japanese mode) keys. This is important as it
offers a way to use this bottom row for thumb keys, like the letter "R" as
used on the left-thumb in many of the "Hands Down" alternative layouts.

This allows us to remap the letter keys while still using the same home row
(although we will use a "wide mod" and shift the hands further apart), while
using (left-command), "eisuu" and spacebar for the left thumb, and "kana",
right-command (and globe/fn?) for the right thumb keys. The number row is
deliberately not altered.

The specific layout I am using is a personal variant of "Hands Down Promethium"
(top/bottom inverted, minor letters moved about) with the punctuation placement
partly based on "Enthium" (top/bottom inverted, unmirrored).

The KE rules are deliberately defined not to be active in Japanese mode,
meaning Kana mode should still work, as will Romaji-Qwerty mode (although
you might want to type romaji using Hands Down?).

This assumes the Karabiner Elements virtual device will be in JIS mode
(important for punctuation to work as expected - but not done yet!).
