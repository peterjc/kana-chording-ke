# Hands Down Promethium on Japanese Apple Keyboard

## Concept

[Karabiner Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) is a free open
source keyboard remapping tool for macOS. The [Hands Down Layout
variations](https://sites.google.com/alanreiser.com/handsdown) are a
family of alternatives to Qwerty, primarily designed for English.
[Hands Down Promethium](https://www.reddit.com/r/KeyboardLayouts/comments/1g66ivi/hands_down_promethium_snth_meets_hd_silverengram/)
released in late 2024 on *Reddit Keyboard Layouts* is intended for split
keyboards with the letter R and space on thumb keys.

The Apple MacBook sold in Japan has a keyboard with a short spacebar (just
over three keys wide, underneath the Qwerty VBN keys), flanked on the by
the "eisuu" (switch to qwerty) and "kana" (switch to Japanese mode) keys.

This lets us remap the Japanese MacBook keyboard into three rows of five
per hand with two keys per thumb:

* The left hand still uses the conventional home-keys (Qwerty ASDF), with
  "eisuu" and space-bar as thumb keys. We apply a "wide mod" to the bottom
  row, but with JIS and ANSI keyboards lacking the ISO key between
  left-shift and Z, we map left-shift to a letter instead.
* In order to have thumb-keys the right hand we must use a "wide mod" and
  move the home position *two* columns further right (starting at Qwerty L),
  with "kana" and right-command for the right thumb keys, and right-shift
  mapped to a letter. Enter becomes an easy horizontal pinkie move.

The canonical Hands Down Promethium layout places Q and Z far right in a
sixth column - but the Hands Down layouts are often used on ergonomic
split keyboards with only five columns for each hand, with Q and Z via
a layer or chording. Here they are moved to the top right corner in favour
of hyphen and equals (which are in the right-hand's core 5x3 block instead),
and placed far right on the navigation layer.

This leaves a 2-2-3 central block (Qwerty YU, HJ, and BNM) into which the
punctuation typically on the right is transplanted (same row and order).
This allows all the letter and punctuation keys to remain on the base
layer, allowing the keyboard to be used without layers or chording combos.

The KE rules are deliberately defined not to be active in Japanese mode,
meaning Kana mode should still work, as will Romaji-Qwerty mode (although
you might want to type romaji using Hands Down?).

## Core Layout

This is my personal variant of the top/bottom row inverted Hands Down
Promethium layout. Left 5 columns, thumbs are R and backspace:

1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5
--|---|---|---|--
V | P | G | M | X
S | N | T | H | K
B | F | D | L | J

Right 5 (or 6) columns, thumbs are shift and spacebar:

1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6
--|---|---|---|---|--
/ | . | ' | - | = | 
, | A | E | I | C | Q
; | U | O | Y | W | Z

As described above, here Q & Z are placed on the Apple keyboard's number row
between the zero and backspace.

My modifications preserve the highest frequency letters (the heart of the
inverted HDP layout) and vi/vim friendly navigation block (H/J left/right,
K/J up/down), plus readline friendly control shortcuts P/N previous/next,
B/F back/forward (and have A/E goto start/end of line).

The punctuation changes are inspired by [Enthium](https://github.com/sunaku/enthium).

## Full layout

Apple Japanese layout as a table, one cell per key except for these three
large keys shown using multiple cells:

* The bottom right shift (‚áß) is roughly two keys wide.
* Enter or return (‚Üµ) on the right is two keys tall (like ISO keyboards).
* The spacebar is just over three letter keys wide.

The cursor keys are not literally a row of four.

1!   | 2" | 3# | 4$ | 5% | 6& | 7' | 8( | 9) | 0  | -= | ^~ | ¬•\| | ‚å´
-----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----|--
Tab  | qQ | wW | eE | rE | tT | yY | uU | iI | oO | pP | @` | [{  | ‚Üµ 
Cntr | aA | sS | dD | fF | gG | hH | jJ | kK | lL | ;+ | :* | ]}  | ‚Üµ 
‚áß    | zZ | xX | cC | vV | bB | nN | mM | ,< | .> | /? | _  | ‚áß   | ‚áß
Caps | ‚å•  | ‚åò  | Ëã±Êï∞  |  |    |   | „Åã„Å™ | ‚åò  | üåê | ‚Üê | ‚Üë | ‚Üì | ‚Üí

Strangley switching to USA or Canadian does not give the expected
punctuation which remains in the Japanese layout. Australian, Irish,
or British work - but I use British PC:

1!   | 2" | 3¬£ | 4$ | 5% | 6^ | 7& | 8* | 9( | 0) | -_ | =+  | \`¬¨ | ‚å´
-----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----|-----|--
Tab  | qQ | wW | eE | rR | tT | yY | uU | iI | oO | pP | [{  | ]}  | ‚Üµ 
Cntr | aA | sS | dD | fF | gG | hH | jJ | kK | lL | ;: | '@  | #~  | ‚Üµ 
‚áß    | zZ | xX | cC | vV | bB | nN | mM | ,< | .> | /? | \\| | ‚áß   | ‚áß
Caps | ‚å•  | ‚åò  | Ëã±Êï∞  |  |    |   | „Åã„Å™ | ‚åò  | üåê | ‚Üê | ‚Üë | ‚Üì | ‚Üí

This is quite familar to me, except the "ISO key" between left-shift
and Z is now bottom right between slash and right-right, and the grave
is top right instead of top left (moving all the numbers slightly left).

With my Hands Down Promethium "pico mod" rules active this becomes:

1!   | 2" | 3¬£ | 4$ | 5% | 6^   | 7&  | 8* | 9( | 0) | `¬¨ | zZ | qQ | ‚å´
-----|----|----|----|----|------|-----|----|----|----|----|----|----|--
Tab  | vV | pP | gG | mM | xX   | [{  | ]} | /? | .> | '@ | -_ | =+ | ‚Üµ 
Cntr | sV | nN | tT | hH | kK   | '@  | #~ | ,< | aA | eE | iI | cC | ‚Üµ 
bB   | fF | dD | lL | jJ | Caps | \\| | `¬¨ | ;: | uU | oO | yY | wW | ‚áß
‚áß    | ‚å•  | ‚åò  | rR | ‚å´  | ‚å´    | ‚å´   | ‚áß  |    | üåê | C | ‚Üë | ‚Üì | ‚Üí

Left-shift is a quite wide key, and becomes the letter B, comfortable
for the pinkie finger.

Note rather than using these middle punctuation keys, I intend to use
layers and chording combinations (see below).
The Q and Z are easily available for shortcuts (like quit and undo).

## Navigation Layer

When the globe key is held down (with a tucked right thumb), the layout
becomes the following (only showing shift for the number row):

1! | 2" | 3¬£ | 4$ | 5% | 6^   | 7& | 8* | 9( | 0) | -_ | =+  | \`¬¨ | ‚å´
---|----|----|----|----|------|----|----|----|----|----|-----|-----|--
4  | 5  | 6  | ¬£  | $  | %    | [  | ]  | Esc | Home | ‚Üë | End | ‚å´  | ‚Üµ 
7  | 8  | 9  | \\ | @  | ^    | '  | #  | PgUp | ‚Üê | ‚Üì | ‚Üí | qQ  | ‚Üµ 
0  | \| | \~ | \# | \& | Caps | \\ | \` | PgDn | ‚å•‚Üê | ‚Üµ | ‚å•‚Üí | zZ | zZ
‚áß  | ‚å•  | ‚åò  | rR | ‚å´  | ‚å´    | ‚å´  | ‚áß  |   | üåê | ‚Üê | ‚Üë | ‚Üì | ‚Üí

This is still in flux. Is the inverted number pad useful?
Should the left thumb become control (original taken by 7)?
Are other layer keys practical using Karabiner Elements?

## Chording Combos

Pressing two horizontally adjacent keys together by moving the hand inwards
(since these keys are normally pressed by the index finger), left hand for
open brackets/braces:

* `M` + `X` for `{` (Qwerty `R` and `T`)
* `H` + `K` for `(`
* `L` + `J` for `[`

Matching right hand combos for closing brackets/braces:

* `/` + `.` for `{` (Qwerty `I` and `O`)
* `,` + `A` for `(`
* `;` + `U` for `[`

etc...
